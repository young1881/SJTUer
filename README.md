SJTUers (a portal system for Shanghai Jiao Tong University students) is an unofficial website application. The purpose of this website is to develop a personalized homepage for SJTU students, integrating the commonly used information of SJTU and daily life.

## Background
The current domestic homepage situation is worrying:
- Common default homepage advertisements are rampant and impractical, such as [hao123](https://www.hao123.com/?from=hao123), [2345](https://www.2345.com/), [360](http://se.360.cn/wz.html), etc.;
- Homepages like default search engines can implement too few functions (only for retrieval), and the UI is not personalized enough;
- When SJTUers visit the common SJTU websites, they often need to memorize the URLs or add them to favorites, and they often need to search for different SJTU related information on different websites, which greatly wastes the time of countless SJTUers.

Compared with existing similar homepages:
- Some people have developed a simple and practical homepage, but the lack of personalization has not been resolved, such as [simple navigater](https://www.jianavi.com/);
- ZJU has built a personalized homepage for the students of the school - [ZJUers](https://zjuers.com/), which has the characteristics of simple domain name, simple interface and complete functions, but its individuality Personalization is only for school personalization, we hope to build a personalized homepage for user units.
